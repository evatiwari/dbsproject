## To start contributing:

2. Create a folder in your system, and using the command line, cd to it. This folder will contain your project.
3. Now cd to this new folder and open command line here. Type "git clone https://github.com/evatiwari/dbsproject.git"
4. Once that is done, type "git remote add origin https://github.com/evatiwari/dbsproject.git"

   difference between the two URLs.
6. Everytime you have added a new feature and it works without showing any errors, type the following commands 
   in the following sequence:
   * git status - to check what needs to be added
   * git add file-name - to add the file to the commit stage
     Alternatively, type git add -A if there are too many files.
   * git commit -m"commit-message" - this should be done once the file names are green. commit message
   should describe the files changed/deleted or functionalities added.
   * git push github master - to push this to the master branch of your fork.
7. Now open your forked repository, an option to send a pull request will appear. Accept it to send a pull
   request to me. I will review your code and accept it accordingly.
8. If you want to keep your local copy of the project updated, type "git pull github master".
